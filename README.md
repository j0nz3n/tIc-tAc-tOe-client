# tIc - tAc - tOe

## At a high level, here are the goals for this project:

-   **Build a web application from scratch**, without a starter codebase
-   Using the programming skills learned so far, map out the game logic for **Tic Tac Toe**
-   **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in your application
-   Build an application **to spec**
-   **Build a dynamic game that allows a user to play tic tac toe against themself**
-   **Communicate with the provided back-end** to store the
    state of your game.

**<u>The current state of this repo:</u>**

  - Check for a win for with either player and also a draw.
  - The game board will only appear after a user has signed up for an account and is signed in.
  - All moves made for that game are passed to the server via --PATCH    


*<u>Take Away</u>*

My biggest takeaway from this project is how crucial time management and breaking down large tasks into easier to manage chunks that can be worked out  in a few minutes. Every time I approached this project it was from a different angle. That lead to frequent errors and undoing what I thought was a good idea. Had I broken down each task into a mini task, I would have met requirements earlier.

I learned a lot about DOM element and jQuery Selectors on elements. In particular: adding eventHandlers to elements before the exist in the DOM is not possible.
