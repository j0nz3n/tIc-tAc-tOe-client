-   Using the programming skills learned so far, map out the game logic for **Tic Tac Toe**
-   **Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files** in your application
-   Build an application **to spec**
-   **Build a dynamic game that allows a user to play tic tac toe against themself**
-   **Communicate with the provided back-end** to store the
    state of your game.
